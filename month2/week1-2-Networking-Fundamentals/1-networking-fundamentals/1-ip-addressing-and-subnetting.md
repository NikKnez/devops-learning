# IP Addressing & Subnetting


## Concepts Learned

### IP Addresses
- IPv4 format: 4 octets (192.168.1.1)
- Classes: A, B, C
- Private vs Public ranges
- Special addresses (localhost, broadcast)

### Subnetting
- CIDR notation (/24, /16, /8)
- Subnet masks (255.255.255.0, etc.)
- Calculating usable hosts
- Network, broadcast addresses

### Commands Practiced
- ip addr show
- ip route
- hostname -I
- cat /etc/resolv.conf

## Real DevOps Application
- Designing AWS VPCs
- Planning Kubernetes networks
- Docker network configuration
- Security group CIDR blocks
- Load balancer subnet placement

## Practice Completed
- Created network information script
- Calculated subnet sizes
- Identified network classes
- Planned multi-subnet designs

## Next: DNS and Domain Names
