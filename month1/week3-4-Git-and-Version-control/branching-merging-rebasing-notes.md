# Branching, Merging, Rebasing


## Key Concepts Learned

### Branching
- Feature branches for new work
- Hotfix branches for urgent fixes
- Always branch from main/master

### Merging
- Fast-forward merge (linear history)
- Three-way merge (creates merge commit)
- Merge conflicts and resolution

### Rebasing
- Clean up commit history
- Interactive rebase to squash commits
- **When to use**: Before merging feature to main
- **When NOT to use**: On shared/public branches

## Commands Learned
- `git branch` - List/create branches
- `git checkout -b` - Create and switch to branch
- `git merge` - Combine branches
- `git rebase` - Replay commits on top of another branch
- `git rebase -i` - Interactive rebase (squash, edit, reorder)

## Real DevOps Applications
1. Feature branches for new infrastructure
2. Hotfix branches for production issues
3. Clean commits before pull requests
4. Team collaboration without stepping on toes

## Practice Projects Completed
- git-basics repo with multiple branches
- Resolved merge conflicts
- Cleaned commit history with rebase
- Simulated team collaboration

## Next: GitHub workflows and pull requests
