# Creating 5 Practice Repos with Real DevOps Scenarios

## Overview: What I am Building
I will create 5 professional repositories that demonstrate real DevOps skills. 
These will be portfolio pieces that show understanding of:
1. Infrastructure automation
2. CI/CD pipelines
3. Container orchestration
4. Monitoring and alerting
5. Configuration management

## Each repo will have:
- Professional README
- Clean commit history
- Proper branching strategy
- GitHub Actions workflow (basic)
- Real-world use case
