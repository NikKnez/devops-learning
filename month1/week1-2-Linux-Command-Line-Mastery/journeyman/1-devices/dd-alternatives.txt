=== dd vs Alternative Tools ===

When to use dd:
✓ Low-level disk operations
✓ Exact bit-for-bit copies
✓ Working with raw devices
✓ Creating disk images
✓ Forensics work

When NOT to use dd (use alternatives):

Instead of dd for file backup → rsync, cp, tar
- Faster
- Progress indicators
- Preserve metadata better

Instead of dd for disk cloning → clonezilla, partclone
- Understands filesystems
- Only copies used space
- Faster for large disks

Instead of dd for USB creation → balenaEtcher, Rufus
- User-friendly
- Harder to make mistakes
- Verification built-in

Instead of dd for secure wiping → shred, wipe, hdparm
- Multiple passes
- Forensically secure
- DOD-compliant patterns

dd advantages:
+ Universally available
+ Simple and reliable
+ Scriptable
+ Fast for sequential operations

dd disadvantages:
- No progress by default (use status=progress)
- Dangerous if misused
- Copies empty space too
- No error recovery
