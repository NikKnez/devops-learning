=== Monitoring udev Events ===

To monitor device events:
./monitor-udev.sh

What you'll see:
- KERNEL events (from kernel)
- UDEV events (after udev processes)

Example event:
KERNEL[1234.567890] add /devices/pci.../block/sdb (block)
UDEV  [1234.567900] add /devices/pci.../block/sdb (block)

This shows:
- Action: add
- Device path
- Subsystem: block
