=== Process Threads ===

What are Threads?
- Lightweight sub-processes
- Share same memory space
- Run concurrently within process
- Cheaper than creating new process

Process vs Thread:
Process:
- Own memory space
- Own resources
- Heavy to create
- Isolated from other processes

Thread:
- Shares process memory
- Shares resources
- Light to create
- Can affect other threads

Why Threads Matter in DevOps:
1. Web servers (Nginx, Apache) use threads
2. Database connections are threads
3. High CPU usage might be one thread
4. Thread leaks cause performance issues

Viewing Threads:

With top:
- top (press 'H' to toggle threads view)
- Each thread shown separately

With ps:
ps -eLf                 # All threads
ps -eL                  # Thread info
ps -T -p PID            # Threads for specific process
ps -p PID -L            # Threads with details

With htop:
- htop (press 'H' to toggle threads)
- Shows threads in tree view

Thread States:
Same as processes: R, S, D, Z, T

Thread Info Columns:
PID    - Process ID
TID    - Thread ID
NLWP   - Number of threads
LWP    - Light Weight Process (thread) ID

Common Thread Issues:

1. Thread Leak:
   - Threads created but not destroyed
   - Memory slowly increases
   - Eventually OOM

2. Thread Contention:
   - Multiple threads competing for resource
   - Slow performance
   - High CPU but low throughput

3. Deadlock:
   - Threads waiting for each other
   - System hangs
   - Requires restart

Finding Thread Info:
cat /proc/PID/status | grep Threads
ls /proc/PID/task/        # One directory per thread
top -H -p PID             # Monitor threads for process
