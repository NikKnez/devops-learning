=== fuser (File User) ===

What is fuser?
- Identifies processes using files or sockets
- Simpler than lsof for basic tasks
- Can send signals to processes

Basic Usage:
fuser filename          # Show PIDs using file
fuser -v filename       # Verbose (show details)
fuser -m /mnt/disk      # All processes using mount point
fuser -k filename       # Kill processes using file
fuser -i -k filename    # Kill with confirmation

Network Usage:
fuser -n tcp 80         # Who's using TCP port 80?
fuser -n tcp 22         # Who's using SSH port?

Access Codes:
c - Current directory
e - Executable being run
f - Open file
F - Open file for writing
r - Root directory
m - Memory-mapped file

Common Use Cases:

1. Unmount busy filesystem:
   fuser -vm /mnt/backup
   fuser -km /mnt/backup  # Kill all
   umount /mnt/backup

2. Find process using port:
   fuser -n tcp 8080

3. Kill processes using file:
   fuser -k /var/log/app.log

fuser vs lsof:
fuser:  Simpler, focused on specific file/port
lsof:   More detailed, more options, network info

DevOps Tip:
Use fuser for quick checks and kills.
Use lsof for detailed investigation.
