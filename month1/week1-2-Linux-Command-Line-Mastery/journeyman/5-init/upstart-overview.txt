=== Upstart Init System ===

What is Upstart?
- Event-based init system
- Developed by Ubuntu (Canonical)
- Used in Ubuntu 6.10 (2006) to 14.10 (2014)
- Replaced by systemd in Ubuntu 15.04+
- Asynchronous, event-driven

Key Improvements Over SysV:
- Event-based (not runlevel-based)
- Parallel service startup
- Automatic respawn of crashed services
- Better dependency handling
- Supervises processes

Upstart Concepts:

Events:
- Starting, started
- Stopping, stopped
- System events (filesystem mounted, network up)

Jobs:
- Services or tasks
- Defined in /etc/init/*.conf
- React to events

Job States:
waiting  - Waiting for start event
starting - About to start
running  - Process is running
stopping - About to stop
stopped  - Not running

Upstart Configuration:
- Location: /etc/init/
- Format: .conf files
- Declarative syntax (not shell scripts)

Basic Upstart Job:
```
# /etc/init/myservice.conf
description "My Service"
start on runlevel [2345]
stop on runlevel [016]

respawn
exec /usr/bin/myservice
```

Why Upstart Failed:
- Not adopted outside Ubuntu ecosystem
- Systemd gained more traction
- Limited tooling compared to systemd
- Ubuntu switched to systemd for compatibility

Legacy Status:
- Removed from modern Ubuntu
- Some concepts influenced systemd
- Historical interest only
