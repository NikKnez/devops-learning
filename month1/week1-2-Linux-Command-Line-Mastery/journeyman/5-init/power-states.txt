=== Linux Power States ===

Power Management Types:

1. SHUTDOWN (Poweroff)
   - System completely off
   - Power removed from hardware
   - Full boot required to start
   - Command: systemctl poweroff

2. REBOOT
   - Shutdown and restart
   - Loads kernel fresh
   - All services restart
   - Command: systemctl reboot

3. SUSPEND (Sleep / Suspend-to-RAM)
   - Low power state
   - RAM powered (keeps state)
   - CPU and disk off
   - Quick wake (seconds)
   - Loses state if power lost
   - Command: systemctl suspend

4. HIBERNATE (Suspend-to-Disk)
   - Saves RAM to disk (swap)
   - Completely powers off
   - Restores state on boot
   - Slower than suspend
   - Survives power loss
   - Requires swap space >= RAM
   - Command: systemctl hibernate

5. HYBRID SLEEP
   - Suspends AND hibernates
   - Quick wake like suspend
   - Safe like hibernate
   - Best of both worlds
   - Command: systemctl hybrid-sleep

6. SUSPEND-THEN-HIBERNATE
   - Suspends first (quick)
   - Hibernates after timeout
   - Saves battery
   - Command: systemctl suspend-then-hibernate

Power State Comparison:

State       Speed   Power   Data Safe   Requires
-----       -----   -----   ---------   --------
Suspend     Fast    Low     No          -
Hibernate   Slow    None    Yes         Swap
Hybrid      Fast    Low     Yes         Swap
Poweroff    N/A     None    Yes         -

Systemd Power Commands:
systemctl poweroff            # Shut down
systemctl reboot              # Restart
systemctl suspend             # Sleep
systemctl hibernate           # Hibernate
systemctl hybrid-sleep        # Hybrid
systemctl suspend-then-hibernate  # Combo

Legacy Commands (still work):
shutdown -h now     → systemctl poweroff
shutdown -r now     → systemctl reboot
halt                → systemctl halt
poweroff            → systemctl poweroff
reboot              → systemctl reboot

Scheduled Shutdown:
shutdown -h +10          # Shutdown in 10 minutes
shutdown -h 20:00        # Shutdown at 8 PM
shutdown -r +5 "Reboot"  # With message
shutdown -c              # Cancel shutdown

ACPI Events:
- Power button pressed
- Lid closed
- Battery low
- Configured in /etc/systemd/logind.conf
