=== Systemd Init System ===

What is Systemd?
- Modern init system and service manager
- Standard on most Linux distributions
- Created by Lennart Poettering (Red Hat)
- First released 2010
- Default since RHEL 7, Ubuntu 15.04, Debian 8

Why Systemd Won:
- Parallel service startup (fast boot)
- Proper dependency management
- Socket and D-Bus activation
- On-demand service starting
- Unified logging (journald)
- Resource management (cgroups)
- Timer units (replaces cron)
- Backwards compatible with SysV

Core Components:

systemd (PID 1)
- Init process
- Service manager
- Process supervisor

systemctl
- Control systemd
- Manage services
- Query system state

journalctl
- Query systemd journal
- View logs

systemd-analyze
- Boot time analysis
- System performance

Key Concepts:

Units:
- Service units (.service) - Daemons/services
- Mount units (.mount) - Filesystem mounts
- Target units (.target) - Group of units
- Timer units (.timer) - Scheduled tasks
- Socket units (.socket) - IPC sockets
- Device units (.device) - Hardware devices
- Path units (.path) - File/directory watching

Unit File Locations:
/lib/systemd/system/       - Distribution defaults
/etc/systemd/system/       - Administrator overrides
/run/systemd/system/       - Runtime units

Dependencies:
Requires=    - Hard dependency
Wants=       - Soft dependency
Before=      - Order dependency
After=       - Order dependency
Conflicts=   - Negative dependency

Advantages:
✓ Fast parallel startup
✓ Automatic dependency resolution
✓ Socket activation (lazy loading)
✓ Resource limits per service
✓ Better process tracking
✓ Transactional activation
✓ Snapshot and restore
✓ Powerful logging

Controversies:
- Binary logs (not plain text)
- Large scope (does many things)
- Breaking Unix philosophy
- Opinionated design
- Required by many desktop environments

DevOps Relevance:
- Industry standard
- Must know for modern Linux
- Container init systems
- Cloud instances
- Kubernetes nodes
