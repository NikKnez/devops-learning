=== SysV vs Systemd Service Commands ===

SysV Commands → Systemd Equivalent:

service nginx start     → systemctl start nginx
service nginx stop      → systemctl stop nginx
service nginx restart   → systemctl restart nginx
service nginx status    → systemctl status nginx
service nginx reload    → systemctl reload nginx

chkconfig nginx on      → systemctl enable nginx
chkconfig nginx off     → systemctl disable nginx
chkconfig --list        → systemctl list-unit-files

service --status-all    → systemctl list-units --type=service

/etc/init.d/nginx start → systemctl start nginx

Why systemctl is better:
- Dependency management
- Parallel startup
- Better logging (journald)
- Socket activation
- Resource limits (cgroups)
- More reliable state tracking
