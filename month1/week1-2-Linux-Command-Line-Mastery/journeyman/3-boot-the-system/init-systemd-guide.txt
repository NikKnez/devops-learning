=== Init Systems: From SysV to systemd ===

What is Init?
- First process started by kernel (PID 1)
- Parent of all processes
- Starts all system services
- Manages system state

Init System Evolution:

1. SysV Init (1980s-2010) - LEGACY
   - Serial startup (one service at a time)
   - Shell scripts in /etc/init.d/
   - Runlevels (0-6)
   - Slow boot times
   - Simple but inflexible

2. Upstart (2006-2015) - TRANSITIONAL
   - Event-driven
   - Parallel startup
   - Used by Ubuntu 6.10-14.10
   - Replaced by systemd

3. systemd (2010-Present) - CURRENT
   - Parallel service startup
   - Dependency-based
   - Faster boot
   - More features
   - Controversial but dominant

systemd Core Concepts:

Units:
- .service  - Services (daemons)
- .socket   - IPC sockets
- .target   - Group of units
- .mount    - Mount points
- .timer    - Scheduled tasks (replaces cron)
- .path     - Path-based activation

Targets (like runlevels):
- poweroff.target       (Runlevel 0)
- rescue.target         (Runlevel 1)
- multi-user.target     (Runlevel 3) - CLI
- graphical.target      (Runlevel 5) - GUI
- reboot.target         (Runlevel 6)

systemd Boot Process:

1. Kernel starts systemd (PID 1)
2. systemd reads /etc/systemd/system/default.target
3. Default is usually multi-user.target or graphical.target
4. systemd analyzes dependencies
5. Starts services in parallel where possible
6. Mounts filesystems
7. Starts network
8. Starts user services
9. Reaches target state

Advantages of systemd:
✓ Parallel startup (faster boot)
✓ On-demand service activation
✓ Better dependency handling
✓ Integrated logging (journald)
✓ Unified management interface
✓ Socket and D-Bus activation
✓ Process supervision

Criticisms of systemd:
✗ Complexity (does too much)
✗ Binary logs (not plain text)
✗ Deviation from Unix philosophy
✗ Difficult to debug
✗ "System bloat"

DevOps Perspective:
- Love it or hate it, it's standard
- Must know systemctl commands
- Understanding units essential
- Logging via journalctl
- Service management in containers mimics systemd
