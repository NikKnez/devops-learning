=== BIOS vs UEFI ===

BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) - LEGACY
- Introduced: 1975
- 16-bit mode
- Limited to MBR partition scheme
- Max disk: 2TB
- Slower boot
- Text-based setup
- Security: None

Boot Process:
1. POST (Power-On Self Test)
2. Read MBR (first 512 bytes of disk)
3. Execute bootloader in MBR
4. Bootloader loads OS

MBR Structure:
- 446 bytes: Bootloader code
- 64 bytes: Partition table (4 entries)
- 2 bytes: Boot signature (0x55AA)

UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) - MODERN
- Introduced: 2005, standard since 2010
- 32-bit or 64-bit mode
- Uses GPT partition scheme
- Max disk: 9.4 ZB (essentially unlimited)
- Faster boot
- GUI setup possible
- Security: Secure Boot, TPM support

Boot Process:
1. UEFI firmware initialization
2. Read EFI System Partition (ESP)
3. Execute bootloader from ESP (.efi file)
4. Bootloader loads OS

ESP (EFI System Partition):
- FAT32 formatted
- Contains bootloaders
- Typically /boot/efi
- ~100-500 MB

Key Differences:

Feature          BIOS              UEFI
-------          ----              ----
Released         1975              2005
Architecture     16-bit            32/64-bit
Partition        MBR (2TB max)     GPT (unlimited)
Boot method      MBR               ESP
Interface        Text              GUI possible
Security         None              Secure Boot
Speed            Slower            Faster
Mouse support    No                Yes

DevOps Considerations:
- Cloud VMs: Usually UEFI
- Containers: Boot process abstracted
- Bare metal: Check BIOS/UEFI mode
- Disk imaging: Different procedures
