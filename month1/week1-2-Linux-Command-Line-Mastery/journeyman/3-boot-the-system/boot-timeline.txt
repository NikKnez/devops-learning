13.0s   Login Ready     getty/GDM       Login prompt or desktop manager

Total Boot Time: ~10-15 seconds (typical)

Parallel vs Serial:

SysV Init (Serial - OLD):
[BIOS] → [GRUB] → [Kernel] → [Init] → [Service1] → [Service2] → [Service3] → [Login]
Total: ~45-60 seconds

systemd (Parallel - MODERN):
[BIOS] → [GRUB] → [Kernel] → [Init] → [Service1]
                                     ↓  [Service2]  → [Login]
                                     ↓  [Service3]
Total: ~10-15 seconds

What Can Slow Boot:
- Old/slow hardware (mechanical HDD vs SSD)
- Too many services
- Filesystem checks (fsck)
- Network timeouts
- Heavy services (databases, web servers)
- GUI initialization

Optimization Tips:
1. Use SSD instead of HDD
2. Disable unnecessary services
3. Use systemd-analyze to find bottlenecks
4. Parallel service starts (systemd does this)
5. Reduce GRUB timeout
6. Use systemd timers instead of cron (faster)
