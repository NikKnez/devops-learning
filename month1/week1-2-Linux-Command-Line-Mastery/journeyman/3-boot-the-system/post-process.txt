=== POST (Power-On Self Test) ===

What Happens During POST?

1. CPU Initialization
   - CPU starts executing firmware
   - Registers initialized
   - Cache flushed

2. Memory Test
   - RAM chips tested
   - Memory controller initialized
   - Bad sectors marked

3. Hardware Detection
   - Keyboard
   - Mouse
   - Storage devices
   - Video card
   - Network card

4. Device Initialization
   - Initialize SATA controllers
   - Initialize USB controllers
   - Initialize PCI devices

5. Boot Device Selection
   - Check boot order (BIOS/UEFI setting)
   - Try each device in order
   - Find bootable device (boot flag or EFI)

POST Beep Codes (BIOS):
- 1 beep: POST successful
- 2 beeps: POST error (see screen)
- 3 beeps: Memory error
- Continuous beep: Power supply or motherboard failure

No Video? Check:
1. Monitor connection
2. Video card
3. RAM seated properly
4. POST beep codes

UEFI Boot Order:
- Set in UEFI setup
- Press F2/F12/Del during boot
- Configure:
  * Boot device priority
  * Secure Boot settings
  * CSM (Compatibility Support Module)

DevOps Relevance:
- Hardware failures: POST catches them
- Boot order: Important for PXE boot
- UEFI settings: Needed for some installs
- Virtual machines: Simplified POST
