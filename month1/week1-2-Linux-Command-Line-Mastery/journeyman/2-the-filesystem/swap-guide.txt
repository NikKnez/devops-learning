=== Linux Swap Space ===

What is Swap?
- Virtual memory extension
- Disk space used as RAM when RAM is full
- Slower than RAM but prevents OOM (Out Of Memory) kills

When is Swap Used?
- RAM is full
- Inactive pages moved to swap
- Hibernation (suspend-to-disk)

Swap Types:
1. Swap Partition - Dedicated disk partition
2. Swap File - Regular file used as swap

How Much Swap?
Old rule: 2x RAM
Modern recommendation:
- RAM <= 2GB:     2x RAM
- RAM 2-8GB:      Equal to RAM
- RAM > 8GB:      8GB or less
- Servers:        Depends on workload

Swap vs No Swap:
With Swap:  System slows but doesn't crash
Without Swap: OOM Killer terminates processes

Swappiness:
- Kernel parameter (0-100)
- How aggressively to use swap
- 0 = Avoid swap unless necessary
- 100 = Use swap aggressively
- Default: 60
- Desktops: 10
- Servers: 1-10
