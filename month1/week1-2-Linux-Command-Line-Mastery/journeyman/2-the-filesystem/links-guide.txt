=== Hard Links vs Symbolic Links ===

HARD LINK:
- Additional name for existing file
- Points to same inode
- Same data, multiple names
- Cannot cross filesystems
- Cannot link to directories
- Deleting original doesn't break link

Create: ln original.txt hardlink.txt

SYMBOLIC LINK (Symlink):
- Pointer to another file/directory
- Has its own inode
- Points to path, not data
- Can cross filesystems
- Can link to directories
- Breaks if original is deleted

Create: ln -s original.txt symlink.txt

Key Differences:

Property          Hard Link        Symbolic Link
---------         ---------        -------------
Inode             Same             Different
Cross filesystem  No               Yes
Link to directory No               Yes
Survives deletion Yes              No (broken link)
File type         Regular file     Link file

When to Use Hard Links:
- Backup without duplicating data
- Multiple names for same file
- Within same filesystem

When to Use Symlinks:
- Shortcuts to files/directories
- Cross-filesystem references
- Dynamic paths (config files)
- Directory links

Common Symlink Uses in DevOps:
/usr/bin/python → /usr/bin/python3
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled → /etc/nginx/sites-available/mysite
/var/www/current → /var/www/releases/v1.2.3
