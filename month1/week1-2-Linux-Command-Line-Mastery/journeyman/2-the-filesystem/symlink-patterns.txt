=== Common Symlink Patterns in DevOps ===

1. Application Versioning:
   /var/www/current → /var/www/releases/20231201-v1.2.3
   
   Benefits:
   - Zero-downtime deploys
   - Easy rollback
   - Just change symlink

2. Config Management:
   /etc/app/config → /etc/app/config.production
   
   Benefits:
   - Switch environments quickly
   - Keep all configs in version control
   - Single source of truth

3. Log Rotation:
   /var/log/app/current.log → /var/log/app/2023-12-01.log
   
   Benefits:
   - Application always writes to same path
   - Easy to rotate logs
   - Archive old logs

4. Tool Versions:
   /usr/local/bin/node → /usr/local/node-v18/bin/node
   
   Benefits:
   - Multiple versions installed
   - Switch versions easily
   - No path changes

5. Shared Resources:
   ~/projects/lib → /shared/company-lib
   
   Benefits:
   - Share code across projects
   - Central updates
   - Save disk space
