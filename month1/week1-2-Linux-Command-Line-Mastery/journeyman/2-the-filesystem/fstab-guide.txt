=== /etc/fstab File System Table ===

Purpose:
- Defines how filesystems should be mounted at boot
- Automatic mounting without manual commands
- System boot depends on this file

Format (6 columns):
<device> <mount point> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>

Example Line:
UUID=abc-123 /home ext4 defaults 0 2

Column 1 - Device:
/dev/sda1                    # Device name (can change!)
UUID=abc-def-123             # UUID (preferred - never changes)
LABEL=mydisk                 # Filesystem label
//server/share               # Network share

Column 2 - Mount Point:
/                # Root
/home            # Home directories
/mnt/data        # Custom mount
none             # For swap

Column 3 - Filesystem Type:
ext4, xfs, vfat, ntfs, swap, nfs, tmpfs

Column 4 - Mount Options:
defaults         # rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, async
ro               # Read-only
rw               # Read-write
noexec           # Don't allow program execution
nosuid           # Ignore setuid bits
noauto           # Don't mount at boot (manual mount only)
user             # Allow regular users to mount
nofail           # Don't halt boot if device missing

Column 5 - Dump:
0 = Don't backup with dump utility
1 = Backup with dump

Column 6 - Pass (fsck order):
0 = Don't check
1 = Check first (root filesystem)
2 = Check after root

CRITICAL WARNINGS:
- Syntax errors prevent boot!
- Always test before rebooting
- Keep backup of working fstab
- Use UUID instead of /dev/sdX (device names can change)

Testing fstab Changes:
sudo mount -a      # Mount all in fstab
sudo findmnt --verify  # Verify fstab syntax
