=== Linux Inodes Explained ===

What is an Inode?
- Index Node
- Data structure storing file metadata
- One inode per file/directory
- Stores everything EXCEPT filename and data

Inode Contains:
- File size
- Owner (UID/GID)
- Permissions
- Timestamps (created, modified, accessed)
- Number of hard links
- Block pointers (where data is stored)
- File type (regular, directory, symlink)

What Inode Does NOT Contain:
- Filename (stored in directory)
- File data (stored in data blocks)

Why Inodes Matter:
- Can run out of inodes even with free space
- Each file needs an inode
- Lots of small files = inode exhaustion
- Shows as "No space left on device" even with free space

Inode Number:
- Unique within filesystem
- Used internally by filesystem
- mv within same filesystem = just change directory entry
- mv across filesystems = copy data + create new inode

Common Commands:
ls -i file.txt       # Show inode number
df -i                # Show inode usage
stat file.txt        # Detailed inode info
find / -inum 12345   # Find file by inode number
