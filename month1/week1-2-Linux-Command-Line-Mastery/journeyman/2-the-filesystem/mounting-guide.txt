=== Mounting Filesystems ===

What is Mounting?
- Attaching a filesystem to the directory tree
- Makes files accessible at a specific path
- Only mounted filesystems are usable

Mount Command Syntax:
sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/mountpoint

Common Mount Options (-o):
ro          - Read-only
rw          - Read-write (default)
noexec      - Prevent execution of binaries
nosuid      - Ignore setuid/setgid bits
nodev       - Ignore device files
defaults    - rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, async

Examples:
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data          # Simple mount
sudo mount -o ro /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data    # Read-only
sudo mount -t ext4 /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data  # Specify type
sudo mount -a                           # Mount all in /etc/fstab

Unmount Command:
sudo umount /mnt/mountpoint
sudo umount /dev/sdX1

Common Unmount Issues:
"Device is busy" - Something is using it
- Check: lsof /mnt/mountpoint
- Or: fuser -m /mnt/mountpoint
- Solution: cd out of directory, close files, kill processes

Force unmount:
sudo umount -f /mnt/mountpoint    # Force
sudo umount -l /mnt/mountpoint    # Lazy (when possible)

Checking What's Mounted:
mount                  # All mounts
df -h                  # Mounted filesystems with usage
lsblk                  # Block devices and mount points
cat /proc/mounts       # Kernel view of mounts
