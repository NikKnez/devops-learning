=== Disk Partitioning Guide ===

WHY PARTITION?
1. Separate OS from user data
2. Multiple operating systems
3. Isolate critical directories (/var, /home)
4. Performance optimization
5. Security (separate /tmp with noexec)

PARTITION TYPES:

Primary Partitions:
- Bootable
- Max 4 on MBR disks
- Can contain filesystem directly

Extended Partition:
- Container for logical partitions
- Only on MBR disks
- Not used with GPT

Logical Partitions:
- Inside extended partition
- Can have many (limited by partition table)

COMMON PARTITION SCHEMES:

Minimal (Single disk):
/dev/sda1  - /boot (500 MB)
/dev/sda2  - swap (RAM size or 2x RAM)
/dev/sda3  - / (rest of disk)

Standard (Single disk):
/dev/sda1  - /boot (1 GB)
/dev/sda2  - swap (8 GB)
/dev/sda3  - / (50 GB)
/dev/sda4  - /home (rest)

Server (Separate /var for logs):
/dev/sda1  - /boot (1 GB)
/dev/sda2  - swap (16 GB)
/dev/sda3  - / (50 GB)
/dev/sda4  - /var (100 GB - logs)
/dev/sda5  - /home (rest)

PARTITIONING TOOLS:
fdisk   - MBR partitions (interactive)
gdisk   - GPT partitions (fdisk for GPT)
parted  - Both MBR and GPT (scriptable)

WARNING: Partitioning destroys data!
Always backup before repartitioning.
