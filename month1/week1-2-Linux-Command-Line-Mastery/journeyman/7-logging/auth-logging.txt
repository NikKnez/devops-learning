=== Authentication Logging ===

Purpose:
- Track login attempts (successful/failed)
- sudo command usage
- SSH connections
- User account changes
- Security auditing

Log Locations:
Ubuntu/Debian: /var/log/auth.log
RHEL/CentOS:   /var/log/secure

What's Logged:
- SSH login attempts
- sudo command execution
- su (switch user) usage
- Failed password attempts
- Account creation/deletion
- Group membership changes
- PAM authentication events

Why It Matters for DevOps:
1. Security: Detect intrusion attempts
2. Compliance: Who did what when
3. Troubleshooting: Why can't user X login?
4. Audit: Track privileged access

Common Patterns to Search:
"Failed password"     - Failed login attempts
"Accepted password"   - Successful logins
"sudo:"               - Sudo command usage
"session opened"      - User logged in
"session closed"      - User logged out
"authentication failure" - Auth failed
