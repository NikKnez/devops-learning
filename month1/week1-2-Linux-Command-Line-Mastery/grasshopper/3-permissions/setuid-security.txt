=== setuid Security ===

What it does:
- File executes with permissions of FILE OWNER, not user who runs it
- Example: /usr/bin/passwd owned by root, runs as root

Why it's dangerous:
- If misconfigured, users could run commands as root
- Security vulnerabilities in setuid programs are critical
- Never create setuid scripts in production

Notation:
Symbolic: -rwsr-xr-x (s in owner execute)
Numeric: 4755 (4 = setuid bit)

Capital S vs lowercase s:
- s = setuid + execute permission
- S = setuid but NO execute (broken/useless)
