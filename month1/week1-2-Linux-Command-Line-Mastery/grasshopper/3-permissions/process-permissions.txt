=== Process Permissions ===

Every process runs with:
1. Real UID/GID - actual user who started process
2. Effective UID/GID - permissions used for access checks

Normal case: Real UID = Effective UID

Special case (setuid) = Real UID = you, Effective UID = file owner

Example: passwd command
- You run it (Real UID = nikola)
- Runs as root (Effective UID = 0)
- Can modify /etc/shadow (root-only file)

Security: Process can only access files that Effective UID can access
