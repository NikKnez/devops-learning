# Emacs

Emacs is for users who want an extremely powerful text editor, which may be an understatement because you essentially live in Emacs. 
You can do all your code editing, file manipulation, etc., all within Emacs. It's a bit slower to load up, 
and the learning curve is a bit steeper than Vim, but if you want a powerful editor that is extremely extensible, 
this is the one for you. 
When I say extensible, I literally mean you can write scripts for Emacs that extend its functionality.
