# Vim Navigation

Now you may notice, the mouse is nowhere in use here. To navigate a text document in Vim, use the following keys:

- h or the left arrow - will move you left one character
- j or the down arrow - will move you down one line
- k or the up arrow - will move you up one line
- l or the right arrow - will move you right one character
