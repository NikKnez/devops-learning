# Vim Inserting and Appending Text

In Vim, you'll primarily work in two modes: 
- Normal mode for executing commands and 
- Insert mode for typing text. 

To switch from Insert mode back to Normal mode, simply press the Esc key.

There are several commands to enter Insert mode, each placing the cursor at a different starting position for your text entry.
