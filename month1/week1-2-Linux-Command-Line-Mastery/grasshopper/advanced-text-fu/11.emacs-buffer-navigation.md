# Emacs Buffer Navigation

In Emacs, a "buffer" is a temporary workspace where you can edit text. 
When you open a file, Emacs loads its contents into a buffer. 
You can also have buffers that don't correspond to a file, such as the *scratch* buffer. 
Efficiently managing these buffers is key to a smooth workflow. 
Mastering emacs navigation between buffers will significantly speed up your editing process.
