# Packages

1. Software Distribution
A Linux system is composed of many software components, such as web browsers, text editors, and media players. 
These components are known as packages, and they are typically managed by a package manager, 
which handles the installation, update, and removal of software. 
Understanding this process is a fundamental part of the best way to learn linux.

2. Package Repositories
How do the vast number of Linux packages available online make their way onto our computers? 
While you could visit the download page for each piece of software, 
a much more efficient solution exists: package repositories.

3. tar and gzip
Before diving into package managers, it's essential to understand file archiving and compression. 
When you download software online, you'll often find it packaged in archived and compressed formats. 
This lesson focuses on two fundamental utilities for this purpose: tar and gzip.

4. Package Dependencies
In the world of Linux, software packages rarely stand alone. 
They often rely on other components, known as dependencies, to function correctly. 
This concept is fundamental to Linux package management.

5. rpm and dpkg
Although most of this course is about package management systems (the Batmans of package management), 
we mustn't forget about the Robins. 
Although very useful and reliable, they don't come with that sweet Batmobile and utility belt.

6. yum and apt
Package managers are essential tools in Linux that simplify installing, updating, and removing software. 
They automatically handle dependencies, ensuring that all required libraries and components are installed correctly. 
Two of the most prominent package management systems are yum and apt.

7. Compile Source Code
Occasionally, you may find a package that is only available as source code. 
To use it, you'll need to compile and install it on your system. 
This lesson will guide you through the common process of how to compile from source code.
