=== tar (Tape Archive) ===

Common tar operations:

CREATE:
tar -czf archive.tar.gz directory/    # Create compressed
tar -cf archive.tar directory/        # Create uncompressed

EXTRACT:
tar -xzf archive.tar.gz               # Extract compressed
tar -xf archive.tar                   # Extract uncompressed

LIST:
tar -tzf archive.tar.gz               # List contents (compressed)
tar -tf archive.tar                   # List contents (uncompressed)

Common flags:
-c = Create archive
-x = Extract archive
-t = List contents
-f = File (must be followed by filename)
-z = gzip compression (.tar.gz or .tgz)
-j = bzip2 compression (.tar.bz2)
-v = Verbose (show progress)
-C = Extract to specific directory

File extensions:
.tar = Uncompressed archive
.tar.gz or .tgz = gzip compressed
.tar.bz2 = bzip2 compressed (better compression, slower)
.tar.xz = xz compressed (best compression, slowest)
