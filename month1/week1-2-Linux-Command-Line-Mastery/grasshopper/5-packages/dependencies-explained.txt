=== Package Dependencies ===

What is a dependency?
- Software package that another package needs to function
- Example: nginx depends on libc6, libssl, etc.

Types of dependencies:
1. Required (hard dependencies)
   - Package won't work without them
   - Must be installed

2. Recommended
   - Strongly suggested but not required
   - Installed by default with apt

3. Suggested
   - Optional enhancements
   - Not installed by default

Dependency hell (old problem):
- Package A needs Package B v1.5
- Package C needs Package B v2.0
- Conflict!

Modern solutions:
- Package managers resolve dependencies automatically
- Containers (Docker) bundle dependencies
- Snap/Flatpak include all dependencies
