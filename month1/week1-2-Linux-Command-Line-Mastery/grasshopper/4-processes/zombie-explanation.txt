=== Zombie Processes ===

What is a zombie?
- Process that finished executing
- Exit status not yet collected by parent
- Shows as "Z" or "<defunct>" in ps

Why do they exist?
- Parent needs to read child's exit status
- Until parent calls wait(), child remains zombie

How to identify:
ps aux | grep 'Z'

How to fix:
1. Parent process calls wait() → zombie cleaned up
2. Kill parent process → init adopts and cleans zombies
3. Cannot kill zombie directly (already dead)

Are they harmful?
- Use minimal resources (just PID table entry)
- Too many zombies can exhaust PID space
- Usually indicates buggy parent process
