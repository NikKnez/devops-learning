=== How Processes Are Created ===

1. fork()
   - Creates exact copy of parent process
   - Parent and child are identical
   - Child gets new PID

2. exec()
   - Replaces current process with new program
   - Same PID, different program

3. Common pattern: fork() + exec()
   - Shell forks itself
   - Child execs the command you typed
   - Parent waits for child

Example: When you run "ls"
1. bash forks → creates child bash
2. Child execs ls → becomes ls process
3. Parent waits for ls to complete
4. ls finishes, parent continues
