=== Controlling Terminal (TTY) ===

TTY = TeleTYpewriter (historical term for terminal)

Types:
- pts/0, pts/1, etc. = Pseudo-terminal (terminal-emulator, SSH)
- tty1, tty2, etc. = Physical virtual console (Ctrl+Alt+F1-F6)
- ? = No terminal (daemon, background process)

Check your terminal:
- tty command shows your current terminal
- ps shows which terminal owns each process

Session leader:
- First process in a terminal session
- Usually your shell (bash)
